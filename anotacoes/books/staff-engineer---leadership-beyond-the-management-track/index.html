  Tech Lead
  
    
    Link to heading
  


Found in: The most common archetype (an organization needs roughly 1 Tech lead for every 8 engineers).
Responsibilities: lead one (or a cluster of) team(s), guiding the approach and execution by scoping, coordinating and delegating projects. Define the team&rsquo;s technical vision, and step in to build alignment within the team on complex issues.
Skills: carrying the team&rsquo;s context; scoping and delegating complex tasks; coordinating and unblocking the team.
Interacts with: partner closely with a single (sometimes two or three) manager(s) and with product manager(s); maintain cross-team and cross-functional relationships.
Reports to: Engineering Manager.
Team&rsquo;s impact grows as the Tech Lead&rsquo;s coding blocks shrink.


  Architect
  
    
    Link to heading
  


Found in: relatively large companies with exceptionally complex or coupled codebases or that are struggling to repay the technical debt.
Responsibilities: success (direction, quality and approach) of a specific technical domain (for example, API design, frontend stack, storage strategy, cloud infrastructure, etc.) that must be complex and enduringly central to the company. Intimate understanding of the business&rsquo; needs, users&rsquo; goals, and relevant technical constraints. Identify and advocate for effective approaches within their area of focus, and do it with organizational authority that they&rsquo;ve earned by demonstrating consistently good judgment. Remain deep in the codebaes or must not write code, depending on the company.
Skills: in-depth knowledge of technical constraints, user needs, and organization level leadership.
Interacts with: (?)
Reports to: (?)

Staff-engineer is not just a role. It&rsquo;s the intersection of the role, your behaviors, your impact, and the organization&rsquo;s recognition of all those things. (page 16)
