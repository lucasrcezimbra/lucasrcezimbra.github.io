(Inspirations: My programming beliefs as of July 2024 and My Principles for Building Software)
Here are my personal thoughts about building software. I&rsquo;m constantly updating
and improving this page.

  Maintainability
  
    
    Link to heading
  


People (developers) time are more expensive than machine time (at least until
the AGI).


  Simplicity
  
    
    Link to heading
  


&ldquo;Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.&rdquo;


  Automated testing
  
    
    Link to heading
  


It&rsquo;s a must, although I believe it is already a consensus in the industry.


  Scalability/Performance
  
    
    Link to heading
  


Computers are fast
Don&rsquo;t try to optimize to solve a problem you don&rsquo;t have
&ldquo;Premature optimization is the root of all evil&rdquo; Donald Knuth
Data-driven optimizations. You need observability to detect bottlenecks and
optimize based on it.
Optimize based on the number of users.
Optimizations Should be driven by the SLAs/SLOs defined by the business.
People (developers) time are more expensive than machine time (at least until
the AGI).
You system is probably IO bound. If so, you don&rsquo;t need a CPU/memory optimized
languages.


  Monolith first. Microservices need justification.
  
    
    Link to heading
  


Microservices add way too much complexity.
If your team doesn&rsquo;t know how to separate concerns in a monolith, they won&rsquo;t
know how to do it in microservices. Unless you are centralizing the
separation decisions, but in this case you are not solving the problem.
Microservices are about team topologies and scaling systems with different types of bounds

Why you should build a (modular) monolith first?

Backend should be the only source of application state.

HTML First




  SQL first. Others need justification.
  
    
    Link to heading
  


SQLite or PostgreSQL is probably all you need.


  Business first
  
    
    Link to heading
  


All code must serve the business.
Technical decisions must be driven by the business.


  PaaS first. Building a platform needs justification.
  
    
    Link to heading
  


Do NOT start building your own platform - PaaS will be better built and
cheaper than hiring DevOps and building internally.
People (Ops) time are more expensive than machine time (at least until the
AGI).
When to build a platform internally?

When the cost of building and maintaining is smaller than paying a PaaS
Or when you have a specific use case not supported by PaaS (uncommon)
