## Team size
- Limit the size of software services/products by the cognitive load that the team can handle.
- each service must be fully owned by a team with sufficient cognitive capacity to build and operate it
- less than 9 people “there are evolutionary reasons for this”?
## Cognitive loads
- The total amount of mental effort being used in the working memory
### Types
- Intrinsic
    - skills
    - “How are classes defined in Java?”
    - becomes natural
- Extraneous
    - mechanism
    - “How do I deploy this app, again?”
    - effective valueless, we don’t want on our teams
- Germane
    - domain focus
    - “How do bank transfers work?”
    - Is part of the problem that we are trying to solve
    - you need this load in your head
    - we want to maximize this
