    * the dumb zone: after ~40% of context used, it starts diminishing returns; YMMV
    * subagents are for managing context, not for specialized roles (QA, Architect, Data Scientist, etc.)
    * Amount of lies graph: the actual code < function names < comments < documentation
    * Frequent Intentional Compaction
      1. research: compression of truth (real code, not docs); agents scanning the codebase and generating `research.md` (300-1000 lines);
      2. human in the loop: read/review/fix
      3. plan: compression of intent; outline exact implementation steps, including filenames, lines and snippets; explicit about testing steps (auto and manual); input: `research.md`` + ticket; output: `plan.md` (300-1000 lines); you must read/review the plan.
      4. human in the loop: read/review/fix
      5. implement
    * Code review is for mental alignment; [ Code Review Essentials for Software Teams &raquo; Blake Smith ](https://blakesmith.me/2015/02/09/code-review-essentials-for-software-teams.html); plan.md can be used to maintain system understanding if you can't read all the code.
    * Coding Agents will be commoditized; the hard part is the culture (team workflow, SDLC, etc.) around it.
    * Prompts: [research](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer/blob/main/.claude/commands/research_codebase.md), [plan](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer/blob/main/.claude/commands/create_plan.md), and [implement](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer/blob/main/.claude/commands/implement_plan.md)
