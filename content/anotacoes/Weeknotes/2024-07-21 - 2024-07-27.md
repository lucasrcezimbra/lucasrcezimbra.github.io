    * progressive JPEGs
        * pros: load a pixeled version that gradually becomes sharper as the
          bytes arrive; tend to be smaller in size.
        * cons: hard to tell when an image has finished loading; takes more CPU
          time to encode and decode (about 2.5 times than nonprogressive);
