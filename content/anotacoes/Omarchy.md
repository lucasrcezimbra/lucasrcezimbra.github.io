- [ ] ðŸ”½ Fingerprint - In my current setup (Debian + XFCE), I have two
  passwords: one for the disk encryption (longer/harder one, only need to type

  Omarchy uses the same password (the longer/harder one) for both, I want to
  configure the fingerprint, so I will have to type the password only once.
