### The Clean Architecture
- A **layered** approach for a more civilized age
  ![](Assets/Pasted_image_20230720162108.png)
- "Your component can see only what is being defined in the inner layer"
- "The problem of unclean systems is dependent components"
- The golden rule: Talk inward with **simple structures**, talk outwards through **interfaces**.
  ![](Assets/Pasted_image_20230720162524.png)
- Pros
	- Testability - be able to test only the business logic

### Django Architecture
- Mentioned unclean patterns
	- ORM that couples with Relational Databases - that's true
	- Models are aware/connected to the database (can be saved/retrieved natively) - partially true
		> When you test your Django application, you need the database. It's possible to test without the database, but you are sort of fighting against the framework.
		
	- "You usually implement your business logic in views" - That's not true. You can do it in every frameworks. But you should avoid in all, including Django.

## Software Development Hour: From Developer to Architect with Nathaniel Schutta
- O'Reilly
- Hosted by Sam Newman
- Differences between Engineer and Architect
	- Need to know more about company politics
	- Have to be more proactive - you need to go to the work
	- More autonomy and accountability
	- Architect needs to deal more with people
	- It's more common to work on PoCs than day-to-day coding
- Tips
	- Try to remove obstacles before it happens
	- Make sure people understand your job/value
	- Focus on skills that last (example: communication, influence)
	- You will need to influence - get people to do what you want by making them think it's his idea
	- You will not know all answers, but you need to know how research and who ask
	- You have a limited social capital (influence currency) - You need to choose your battles.
- How to bring global context to your local team? Help the team to see the big picture.
	- Translate the message (security, performance, etc) for the particular audience. Business will not care about tech. 
	- Maintenance - "Did you go to an airplane that didn't have maintenance for months/years?
- Book - How to win friend and influence people - It will help in your architecture role.
