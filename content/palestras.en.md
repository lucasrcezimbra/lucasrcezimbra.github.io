## Python to Automate Financial Control (Portuguese)

- Date: 2019-08-17
- Event: [PyCaxias](https://pycaxias.org/)
- Description: In this talk I showed how we can use Python and its tools to automate the extraction of your bank data and create a financial control system that is filled automatically. So you can spend time on the most important thing, which is to analyze your finances instead of spending time filling spreadsheets and/or systems. In addition, you can take control of your data to use it as you wish.
